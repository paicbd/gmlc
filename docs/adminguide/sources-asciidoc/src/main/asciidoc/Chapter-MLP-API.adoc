= MLP API

MLP is an XML language specified by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). {this-platform} {this-application} uses OMA MLP v 3.4 as defined in : http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/MLS/V1_3-20150512-A/OMA-TS-MLP-V3_4-20150512-A.pdf, with some extensions that apply to MAP and Diameter operations/commands used by {this-platform} {this-application}.

The following table describes the XML elements for triggering MAP and Diameter operations out of OMA MLP specification with some extensions in {this-platform} {this-application}. For these purposes, the following services are used by {this-platform} {this-application} for triggering MAP and Diameter services in the control plane of mobile core networks. In next releases, it will also be used for making location requests in the user plane via OMA Secure User Plane Location (SUPL).

As for up-to-date version of {this-platform} {this-application}, the following OMA MLP services are used:

* *Standard Location Immediate Service*. Used for requesting the location of one or more Mobile Subscribers. The service is used when a single location response is required immediately (within a set time) or when several asynchronous location responses can be returned (until a predefined timeout limit is reached). Request/Answer of this service: *SLIR*/*SLIA*.
* *Triggered Location Reporting Service*. Used when an application wants the position of several MSs to be tracked upon events such as change of area, distance, an action of the mobile subscriber such as becoming available, a distance event since the last report, a velocity event, etc. Request/Answer XML root elements of this service: *TLRR*/*TLRA*.
* *Standard Location Reporting Service*. Used when a mobile subscriber wants an LCS client to receive the MS location, e.g. by initiating a MO-LR procedure according to [23.271]. {this-platform} {this-application} also uses this service for  MAP or Diameter LCS reports upon RAN events such as emergency call origination.  Request/Answer XML root elements of this service: *SLREP*/*SLRA*.
