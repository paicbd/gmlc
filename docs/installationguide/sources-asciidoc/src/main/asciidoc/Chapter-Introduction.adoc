= Introduction

{this-platform} {this-application} is a Java based Gateway Mobile Location Center that allows building location-based service applications.

{this-platform} {this-application} acts as an intermediary platform linking the service applications to all up to date ITU/3GPP cellular networks (GSM/UMTS/LTE/5G).
The platform is easy-to-install and easy-to-deploy allowing you to have the Gateway set up and configured very quickly.

{this-platform} {this-application} is based on the robust and proven JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server, jSS7 and jDiameter stacks. JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment.
It provides a set of connectors to a variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, TCAP, INAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others.
It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1).

jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol. It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled with and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack.
Likewise, jDiameter is a software based implementation of the Diameter protocol. {this-platform} {this-application} uses the implementation of SLh, SLg Diameter-based interfaces for location services in LTE networks, as well as the Sh Diameter-based interface implementation for retrieving location information from the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) as the IMS/EPC (IP Multimedia Subsystem/Evolved Packet Core).

{this-platform} {this-application} makes use of HTTP protocol between the gateway and third-party applications or Value-Added Services (VAS) modules. {this-platform} {this-application} gathers the location information either from the Circuit-Switched (GSM/UMTS) or Packet-Switched Core Network (GPRS/IMS/LTE/5G) and then translates these message signaling units into HTTP in JSON or OMA MLP format back to the corresponding (VAS) or third-party application requester.
The HTTP callback mechanism allows the third-party application to be agnostic of Operating System, Programming Language and Framework.

This guide will assist you in installing {this-platform} {this-application} .
For more details on configuring and using the platform, please refer to the {this-platform} {this-application} User Guide.
